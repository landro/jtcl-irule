{"name":"Jtcl-irule","tagline":"An extension to JTcl that implements all the functionality F5 added to the Tcl language","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is an extension to [JTcl](http://jtcl.kenai.com/) that implements all the functionality F5 added to the Tcl language.\r\n\r\n# Download binary\r\n\r\nInstead of building this project yourself, you can download the binary from [bintray](https://bintray.com/landro/maven/TesTcl)\r\n\r\n# Building\r\n\r\nFetch the [source](https://hg.kenai.com/hg/jtcl~jtcl-main) of [JTcl](http://jtcl.kenai.com/) using mercurial and replace the maven-jar-plugin config with the following in order to generate the test jar \r\n\r\n     <plugin>\r\n        <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>\r\n        <version>2.2</version>\r\n        <executions>\r\n          <execution>\r\n            <id>default-jar</id>\r\n            <phase>package</phase>\r\n            <goals>\r\n              <goal>jar</goal>\r\n            </goals>\r\n            <configuration>\r\n              <archive>\r\n                <manifest>\r\n                  <mainClass>tcl.lang.Shell</mainClass>\r\n                </manifest>\r\n                <manifestEntries />\r\n              </archive>\r\n            </configuration>\r\n          </execution>\r\n          <execution>\r\n            <goals>\r\n              <goal>test-jar</goal>\r\n            </goals>\r\n          </execution>\r\n        </executions>\r\n      </plugin>\r\n\r\nIf you're using Mac Os X and don't have mercurial installed, I recommend using the [Source Tree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) app from the app store.\r\nIt has excellent support for both git and mercurial.\r\nThe next step, is to build and install the artifacts into your local maven repository using\r\n\r\n    mvn clean install -DskipTests\r\n\r\nWARNING! you have to use JDK version 1.6. You can achieve this by setting JAVA_HOME appropriately.\r\n    \r\nNext, fetch the source code of this project, and align the _jtcl.version_ property in _pom.xml_in with the JTcl version. Then, build the project using:\r\n\r\n    mvn clean package\r\n\r\nThis will generate a jar file named *jtcl-irule.jar* in the _target_ directory.\r\nThis jar file has to be added to the classpath of the JTcl shell script in order to override som of the functionality found in JTcl.\r\nPlace it in front of the other jar file - it will take precedence. See TesTcl installation instructions for details.\r\n\r\n# What has been implemented so far\r\n\r\nAll the special iRule operators have now been implemented!\r\n\r\nOriginal JTcl source code was modified in order to support the following iRule operators:\r\n\r\n__iRule only operators__\r\n\r\n- *starts_with* Tests if one string starts with another string\r\n- *ends_with* Tests if one string ends with another string\r\n- *contains* Tests if one string contains another string\r\n- *matches_glob* Implement glob style matching within a comparison\r\n- *matches_regex* Tests if one string matches a regular expression\r\n\r\n__iRule aliases to standard Tcl operators__\r\n\r\n- *equals* Tests if one string equals another string (*eq* operator)\r\n- *and* Performs a logical \"and\" comparison between two values (*&&* operator)\r\n- *or* Performs a logical \"or\" comparison between two values (*||* operator)\r\n- *not* Performs a logical \"not\" on a value (*!* operator)\r\n\r\nThe only files that have been modified are:\r\n\r\n- Expr.java\r\n- expr.test\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\nBoth jtcl-irule and JTcl are released under a BSD-style license.
